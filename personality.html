				 <h2 style="color: purple; background-color: lavender;"> ATTICUS FINCH </h2>
		  
				  <p> During highschool, I was required to read the book "To Kill a Mockingbird" for the CSEC English B Examination. Through reading this book, Atticus Finch, a fictional character from Harper Lee's book really resonated with me. One of the powerful scenes from "To Kill a Mockingbird" involves Atticus Finch defending Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman. In the courtroom, Atticus delivers a passionate closing statement, advocating for justice and equality despite the deeply ingrained prejudices of the time. Atticus said these words:
"You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... until you climb into his skin and walk around in it." 
 He is often regarded as a moral compass and a symbol of integrity, justice, and empathy. I chose Atticus because his unwavering commitment to doing what is right, standing up against prejudice, and teaching his children valuable life lessons makes him a role model for me. The quote reflects Atticus's philosophy of understanding and empathy, and urges me to consider perspectives different from my own in order to foster understanding and compassion. </p>

						  <h2 style="color: purple; background-color: lavender;"> HOW MY HOBBIES AND TRAITS IMPACT MY ACADEMIC LIFE </h2>
						  
						<p><b>READING</b></p>
				   <p> My fond hobby of reading has had various impacts on my academic life. Reading has positively contributed to the enhancement of my vocabulary and language skills. This is as reading a wide variety of books exposes me to a more diverse vocabulary. Over time, this exposure has expanded, allowing me to articulate my thoughts and ideas more effectively in both written assignments and verbal communication. Secondly, reading has allowed me to improve my critical thinking skills. Through analyzing plots, character developments, and underlying messages in books my mindset has become sharper and more analytical. Furthermore, it has helped me in understanding complex academic concepts and problem-solving, especially in subjects that demand deep analysis and reasoning.
					   <br>
					  <p><b> PERSEVERANCE </b></p>
					  Along with my hobbies, my traits have significant impacts on my academic life. My strongest trait, perseverance has allowed me to be resilient in the face of challenges and enables me to bounce back from the setbacks and challenges I may encounter in my academic journey. When facing difficulties with subjects, assignments, or even academic failures, I don't give up. Instead, I remain determined and work harder to understand the concepts, seek help, or improve my strategies, in order to overcome the challenges and achieve my academic goals.</p>

						<h2 style="font-family: cursive; background-color: #FA86C5;"> test validity </h2>
						
						<p> I think that the Keirsey Temperament Sorter personality test has some level of validity. This is as it asked a series of questions in order to assess and determine the personality type that aligns best to an individual. However even though it has some validity, people are unique, dynamic, and are influenced by a multitude of factors over time, and I personally believe no personality test can fully capture this complexity, and individuals may exhibit traits and behaviours that span multiple temperaments. Thus, in my case of recieving 'Guardian' results, I think some of attributes, such as being dependable, helpful, and hard-working aligns with me well. However, on the other hand, I don't think the attribute of sticking to traditions aligns perfectly with my personality.</p>
